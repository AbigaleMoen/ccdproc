Please have a look at the following list and replace the "[ ]" with a "[x]" if
the answer to this question is yes.

- [ ] For new contributors: Did you add yourself to the "Authors.rst" file?
- [ ] For bugfixes and new functionality: Did you add an entry to the
      "Changes.rst" file?
- [ ] For bugfixes: Did you add a regression test?
- [ ] For new functionality: Did you include a meaningful docstring with
      Parameters, Returns and Examples?
- [ ] For bugfixes and new functionality: Does the commit message include a
      "Fixes #issue_number" (replace "issue_number").
- [ ] For new functionality: Did you include tests for the new functionality?
- [ ] For documentation changes: Does your commit message include a "[skip ci]"?
      Note that it should not if you changed any examples!
- [ ] Does this PR add, rename, move or remove any existing functions or parameters?

Please note that the last point is not a requirement. It is meant as a check if
the pull request potentially breaks backwards-compatibility.
